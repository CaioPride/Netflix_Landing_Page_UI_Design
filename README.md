# Netflix_Landing_Page_UI_Design
<br>
First I need to say that __I do not own any images__ in this project and this wasn't built with 
any commercial purpose, but as most of the cloning projects out there, to get the interviewer 
immediately related with something that he is already associated. 
<br><br>
The PNGs came from various sources 
<br>
The background came from wall.alphacoders 
<br>
I edited some details with Inkscape and exported the vector to jpg
